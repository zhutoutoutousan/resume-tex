\section{Job Interests}
I am thrilled about opportunities to work as frontend developer with flexible experiences in the emerging tech field in a global environment! I have five years of diversified experience in full-stack development, website building, UX design, and general coding. I am fluent in both English and Chinese and many other languages with IELTS 7.5(back in 2019 and I never bothered taking again). I also have an AWS developer and SysOps administrator certificate. Finally, I am a language hound, I can speak English, German, French, and Spanish fluently, and I know the basics of Italian, Hindi, Russian, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, and Japanese. Namelos.xyz is the name of my own development studio.
